## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Google Blue (#4285F4) to mirror the legitimate Google login page, establishing a sense of familiarity and trust.
- Background color: Light gray (#F1F3F4), nearly white but visually distinct, to keep contrast acceptable.
- Accent color: A slightly desaturated, lighter shade of Google Blue (#619df9), providing subtle but effective contrast for buttons and active elements.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for both headlines and body text, to mimic Google's UI precisely and maintain a clean, neutral appearance. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Pixel-perfect clone of Google's login interface.
- Google's Material Design icons where applicable.
- Use subtle transitions, similar to Google's login flow.
